# Security Remediation Report - Resend API Key Exposure

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue Summary
**Date:** July 3rd, 2025, 08:52:35 UTC  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Secret Type:** Resend API Key  
**Repository:** AadidevRaizada/Fullahead  
**Exposed Key:** `re_7gPPffmZ_E6Voeyob7ZxaFxgHMRQ7RiRb`

## ‚úÖ Actions Completed

### 1. **Removed Hardcoded API Key**
- **File:** `api/send-email.js`
- **Action:** Replaced hardcoded Resend API key with environment variable
- **Before:** `const resend = new Resend('re_7gPPffmZ_E6Voeyob7ZxaFxgHMRQ7RiRb');`
- **After:** `const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);`

### 2. **Added Security Validation**
- Added environment variable validation with error handling
- Application will now fail gracefully if API key is missing

### 3. **Created Environment Documentation**
- Created `.env.example` file with proper documentation
- Verified `.env` is already in `.gitignore` (‚úÖ Good!)

### 4. **Scanned for Additional Secrets**
- Performed comprehensive scan for other exposed credentials
- No additional secrets found

## üö® CRITICAL NEXT STEPS (DO IMMEDIATELY)

### 1. **Revoke the Exposed API Key**
```bash
# Go to your Resend dashboard immediately:
# https://resend.com/api-keys
# 
# 1. Find the exposed key: re_7gPPffmZ_E6Voeyob7ZxaFxgHMRQ7RiRb
# 2. Delete/Revoke it immediately
# 3. Generate a new API key
```

### 2. **Set Up New Environment Variables**
```bash
# Create a .env file (DO NOT COMMIT THIS)
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your NEW API key:
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_new_api_key_here
```

### 3. **Update Production/Deployment Environment**
- If deployed on Vercel/Netlify/etc., update environment variables there
- Ensure the new API key is set in your hosting platform's environment settings

### 4. **Commit the Security Fix**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Security: Remove exposed Resend API key, use environment variables"
git push origin main
```

## üîí Security Improvements Made

1. **Environment Variable Usage**: API key now loaded from secure environment variables
2. **Error Handling**: Application validates API key presence at startup
3. **Documentation**: Clear documentation of required environment variables
4. **Git Protection**: Confirmed `.env` files are excluded from version control

## üìã Future Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit secrets**: Always use environment variables for sensitive data
2. **Use secret scanning**: Consider GitHub's secret scanning or tools like GitGuardian
3. **Regular audits**: Periodically review code for hardcoded credentials
4. **Principle of least privilege**: Use API keys with minimal required permissions
5. **Key rotation**: Regularly rotate API keys and secrets

## ‚ö° Impact Assessment

- **Immediate Risk**: HIGH - API key was publicly accessible
- **Post-Fix Risk**: LOW - Key will be revoked, new secure implementation in place
- **Business Impact**: Minimal if new key is deployed quickly

## üîß Technical Details

### Files Modified:
- `api/send-email.js` - Removed hardcoded key, added validation
- `.env.example` - Added for documentation

### Environment Variables Required:
- `RESEND_API_KEY`: Your Resend API key for email functionality

**‚ö†Ô∏è URGENT**: The exposed API key `re_7gPPffmZ_E6Voeyob7ZxaFxgHMRQ7RiRb` must be revoked immediately from your Resend dashboard to prevent unauthorized usage.
